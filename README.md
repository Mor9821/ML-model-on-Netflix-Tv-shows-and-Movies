# ML-model-on-Netflix-Tv-shows-and-Movies
Problem Statement

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.

In this project, you are required to do

Exploratory Data Analysis

Understanding what type content is available in different countries.

If Netflix has been increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.

Clustering similar content by matching text-based feature

The aim of this project is to analyze the Netflix dataset of movies and Tv shows until 2019, sourced from the third-party search engine flixable. The goal is to group the content into relevant clusters using NLP techniques to improve the user experiance through the recommendation system. This will help to prevent subscriber churn for Netflix, which currently has over 277 million subscibers.

The project followed a step-by-step process:

Handling null values in dataset.
Managing nested columns.
Binning the rating aatributes into the categories.
Performing Exploratory data analysis to gain insight for preventing subscribers churn.
Creating clusters using attributes like director, cast, country, rating and description. These attributes were tokenized, preprocessed and text vectorized using tf-idf vectorizer.
Reducing the dimensionality of the datset using PCA to improve performance.

CLUSTERING FOR ML MODEL

Employing K-means clustering , hierarchical clustering and Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering algorithm, the determine optimal cluster numbers through various evalution methods.
For the analysis of the movies and TV shows dataset, one of the models we used is K-Means Clustering. K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering tasks. It aims to partition a set of observations into K clusters where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.
